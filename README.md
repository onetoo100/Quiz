# Quiz
Quiz project with a timer built using OPP

	- It is a simple page that shows us a quiz. The user chooses the correct answer and the next question appears.
	- If the user doesn't choose any question before the time end, the next question appears automatically and doesn't increase the score.
	- When the user completes the question, the simple score appears on the screen.
	- The time changes color as the time increases.
	- The questions are fixed in a file and the time is 15'.

Why the project is useful
